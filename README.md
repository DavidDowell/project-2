## INTRODUCTION
------------

Tik-Tak is a full stack web application that aims to allow users to post their or their friends' hot takes on various topics, including sports, relationships, and much more. Users can interact with other users' posts, and are able to leave comments and upvote/downvote. 

This was the group's first collaborative full-stack web application project--throughout planning and development, team communication was excellent. The project challenged all of us and served as valuable experience for professional development. 

## REQUIREMENTS
------------

## This project requires the installation of Node.js, which can be accessed from the link below:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/


## INSTALLATION
------------

After Node.js has been installed, the following technologies must be installed within a local terminal:
Express.js (using npm i express)
Express Handlebars (using npm i express-handlebars)
Path (using npm i --save path)
Express-Session (using npm i express-session)
Connect Session using Sequelize (using npm i connect-session-sequelize)
Anime.js (using npm i animejs --save)


## FUNCTIONALITY
-------------

First, navigate to the deployed application on Heroku: 
https://p2tiktak.herokuapp.com/ 

The application will first prompt the user to register an account; after providing the required information, the user will be given the option to log in. 
After logging in, the user will notice several sections of the website: the dashboard, the homepage, and the log-out link.

On the dashboard, click "create post" and the user will be prompted with a block from which you can select a category and provide text content. 
The premise of the website is to post content that, due to its absurdity, will aggravate/irritate other users. An example would be a post reading
"The Detroit Lions Have a Chance this Year!!", which from a football fan's perspective would be nothing short of an outrageous statement, 
considering the Lions are 2-6 and have all but no chance to make the playoffs. Following the creation of the post, it will appear on the website's homepage,
which can be accessed from the dashboard by clicking on the Tik-Tak logo in the left corner of the navigation bar.

On the homepage, the user will be able to see other user's posts, as well as any comments other users have left on them and the upvote/downvote counts. 
The user will be able to leave a comment by clicking on the comment button, and leave their vote by clicking on the thumbs up/thumbs down icons. The user will
also be able to see in what category each post is labeled under. 

If a user wishes to sign out of the application, they can click on the "log out" button on the right corner of the navigation bar. They will be redirected to the 
application's login page.
